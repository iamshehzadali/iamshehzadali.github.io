&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Context:</i> BPMN models are the de facto standard for communicating how an organization’s processes work,
thus becoming an important artifact in the process of developing and evolving the software that supports an
organization. Software Evolution implies an effort in making the constant changes, that must be controlled,
from their estimate until their realization. Having strategies and tools to manage traceability between software
artifacts improves estimates and facilitates change realization; however, the traceability between BPMN models
and source code is an area in study.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Objective:</i> The aim of this systematic review is to examine existing literature for the traceability in
software development between BPMN models and source code, their approaches, technologies, techniques,
traced artifacts and tools, open issues and future directions.<br>
Method: We conducted a systematic mapping, with the next steps: (i) we selected the most recognized
databases for software area publications to perform the search, (ii) we mixed several keywords and phrases
related to traceability and BPMN, for constructing the query string; next, (iii) we applied a screening and a
series of inclusion and exclusion criteria to collect the final papers for analyzing.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Results:</i> we get 279 primary studies in the search stage; after two screenings and applying inclusion/exclusion
criteria we obtained 17 relevant papers. when we analyzed them we found that MDE is the main approach,
SOA is the main technology, graphs use is an emerging technique for managing versioning and change impact
analysis, and the trend in tools is using extension of existing platforms for providing traceability management.
Regarding traced artifacts, variety is the commonplace, so we propose classifying them in high-level, low-level
and BPMN-level models. Additionally, analyzing the papers following the SwEBok concepts, we found that
issues as cost estimation and traceability in tests are issues with scarce or no research.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Conclusion:</i> The traceability from BPMN is an emerging area of study, it involves concerns as levels
of BPMN models traceability, using MDE, links among BPMN models and software artifacts, using SOA
technologies, and graphs as an emerging technique for managing versioning.<br><br>
